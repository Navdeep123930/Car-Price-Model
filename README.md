# Car-Price-Model


The objective of this mini project is to build a model using Tensorflow which can predict the selling price of a car based on the different features.
Due to the small amount of presented data in the dataset,we must be carefull to not create an overly complex model, which could lead to overfitting our data.For this, i adopted an architecture based on single Dense layers with just one neuron.
I built this model based on multiple features such as top speed,hp,torque,on road old,on road now,years,km,rating,condition,economy to predict the price of second hand car. 
The model was fit with both our features and their labels, for a total amount of 50 epochs, separating 25% of the samples as validation set.
I applied various Python tools to get a better visual understanding of the data.

This project uses the following software and libraries:

Python
Tensorflow
Keras
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn etc...
Thank You
